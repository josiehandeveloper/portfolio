               <p class="intro">  I am an aspiring software engineering student at Thinkful, living in the Los Angeles area.</p>
               <p>Currently, I am in the process of learning coding languages like Javascript, Html, and CSS.</p>
               <p> As someone who loves the visual aspect of web design. I want to create websites that are clean and minimalistic. I find that a 
                 successful website incorporates great code and easy to navigate user interface. Not only is code important,
                but so is the relationship between how users interact with the website.</p>

      <h2> About Josephine </h2>
       <div class="group"> 
         <div class="item item-double"> 
           <p> I've always been interested with how websites work. I've had such a great experience making my own website
             that I decided to become a student at Thinkful. Web design incorporates different skills that I enjoy, 
             technical coding skills along with design components that are interweaved to create the final product. </p>

             <p> As a student, I am open to collaborate with other developers. I am willing to take on any challenges that will help me become a better developer. </p>

             <p> Outside of coding, I enjoy traveling to different countries. Last year, I went on a solo backpacking
             trip to Thailand. I really want to go back to South East Asia and immerse myself in different cultures. </p>
      
             <p>Services I would like to provide:</p>
      
             <ul>
               <li>Develop a complete and functional website</li>
               <li>Focus on great design, making the finished product aesthetically pleasing</li>
               <li>Incorporate aspects of user interface and user experience</li>
             </ul>
